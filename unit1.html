## Unit Overview

Build foundations in measurement/precision, matter & classification, atomic structure (with nuclear basics), organization of the periodic table, bonding foundations, and **systematic naming** (ionic, covalent, acids, hydrates). The unit concludes with a real-world project showing why naming and structure matter for safety and communication.

Standards for Unit 1: <a href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/pe/hs-ps1-1-matter-and-its-interactions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HS-PS1-1</a> <a href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/pe/hs-ps1-8-matter-and-its-interactions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HS-PS1-8</a>

## Essential Questions

  1. EQ1: How do scientists use measurement, models, and classification systems to understand matter?
  2. EQ2: How does atomic structure explain the behavior of matter, and how do naming systems allow scientists to communicate universally?
