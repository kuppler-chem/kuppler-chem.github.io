<h2>Unit Overview</h2>
<p>
This unit introduces laboratory safety and measurement, reviews matter and classification, develops atomic structure (including nuclear basics), explores periodic organization and bonding foundations, and builds fluency with <em>systematic naming</em> (ionic, covalent, acids, hydrates). The unit concludes with a real-world project on why naming and structure matter for safety and communication.
